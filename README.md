 *  I)      What is Puppynux?
 *  *************************
 * Puppynux is a video game allowing a player to train an animal. The animal starts acting blindly in an selected environment.
 * The player can attribute reward by the interface, and the animal will adapt accordingly.
 * It's time for you to adopt a new virtual pet !
 *
 *  II)     Why Puppynux ?
 *  **********************
 * This project began in the school frame, we had for instruction to realize a smart program in Java.
 * The subject was the training of an animal, so we decided to turn it around a video game.
 *
 *  III)    How to install Puppynux ?
 *  *********************************
 * Be sure to have Java version >= 1.8 installed on your computer.
 *
 *  IV)     How to use Puppynux ?
 *  *****************************

 * WARNING :
 * Do not try to :
 *  °load game before having one saved
 *  °check stats before having saved a game
 *  °set IA when game is not running
 *
 *   V)      How works Puppynux ?
 *   ****************************
 * We use a complex implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm in order to make the animal appears intelligent.
 * The environment and the animal are managed by a treatment class (respectively EnvironmentManager and AIManager).
 * Both are supervised by the GameEngine class, that makes proxy with GUI
 *
 *  VI)     Term of Use.
